Requires WP-Members to be in use. Uses members' emails as their usernames. Removes the need to create a username (if wp-members is in use).

== Description ==

Requires WP-Members to be in use. Uses members' emails as their usernames. Removes the need to create a username (if wp-members is in use). Changes or removes appropriate items from forms, and adds the email address as the username. If WP-Members is no longer in use, there are plenty of plugins that offer this capability for WP's native registration and login functions

**How it works:**
This plugin doesn't do much of anything with the login form. It deals with the WP-Members registration form, removing username as a field to fill out and filling it automatically with the email entered.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure the WP-Members plugin is installed and activated
1. Turn the WordPress native Registration off (users can still register through WP-Members)
1. Upload the `/email-as-username-wpmem` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work without WP Members activated? =

I highly doubt it. This plugin does not attempt to control the native WordPress registration
